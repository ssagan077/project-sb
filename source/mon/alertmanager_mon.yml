# Sample configuration.
# See https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration/ for documentation.

global:
  # The smarthost and SMTP sender used for mail notifications.
  resolve_timeout: 5m

# The directory from which notification templates are read.
#templates: 
  #- '/etc/prometheus/alertmanager_templates/*.tmpl'

# The root route on which each incoming alert enters.
route:
  # The labels by which incoming alerts are grouped together. For example,
  # multiple alerts coming in for cluster=A and alertname=LatencyHigh would
  # be batched into a single group.
  group_by: ['alertname']

  # When a new group of alerts is created by an incoming alert, wait at
  # least 'group_wait' to send the initial notification.
  # This way ensures that you get multiple alerts for the same group that start
  # firing shortly after another are batched together on the first 
  # notification.
  group_wait: 10s

  # When the first notification was sent, wait 'group_interval' to send a batch
  # of new alerts that started firing for that group.
  group_interval: 10s

  # If an alert has successfully been sent, wait 'repeat_interval' to
  # resend them.
  repeat_interval: 24h
